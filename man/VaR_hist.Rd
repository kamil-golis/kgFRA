\title{A function that calculates Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall using historical simulation method - defined for a given stock, time horizon and significance level.}
\usage{
VaR_hist(
  symbol,
  start_date = Sys.Date() - 365,
  end_date = Sys.Date(),
  price_type = "close",
  output_type = "percent",
  rounding = 2,
  p = 0.05,
  h = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{symbol}{Stock symbol.}

\item{start_date}{Start date for gathering the stock prices - default set as one year ago.}

\item{end_date}{End date for gathering the stock prices - default set as the latest available day.}

\item{price_type}{Type of prices that are to be analyzed - decide between 'open' and 'close' (default 'close').}

\item{output_type}{States how the output is expressed - decide between 'percent' (result presented in percentage) and 'float' (result not modified) - default set as 'percent'.}

\item{rounding}{The level of rounding for the output - default set as 2 decimal places.}

\item{p}{Level of significance as decimal - default set as 0.05 (5\%).}

\item{h}{Time horizon for the Expected Shortfall calculation - epxressed in days - default set as 1.}
}
\value{
A 2-element list containing Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall is returned.
}
